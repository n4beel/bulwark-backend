## When You Export Multiple Reports

If you have 3 contracts analyzed, the CSV will look like this:

```csv
Factor,Category,damm-v2-main,raydium-amm,popfi-staking
Repository,Basic Information,damm-v2-main,raydium-amm,popfi-staking
Total Lines of Code,Structural,7607,8234,5432
DeFi Patterns - Total Count,Economic,40,25,10
DeFi Patterns - AMM Count,Economic,25,20,5
DeFi Patterns - Lending Count,Economic,1,0,0
DeFi Patterns - Vesting Count,Economic,14,5,5
Economic Risks - Overflow Count,Economic,9,3,1
Economic Risks - Division By Zero Count,Economic,4,2,0
Economic Risks - Precision Loss Count,Economic,3,1,1
Program Derives - Total Count,Anchor,217,150,89
Unwrap Usage,Security,107,45,23
Analysis Time (ms),Performance,37317,28456,19234
```

This format allows you to:
- **Compare contracts side-by-side** (each contract is a column)
- **See trends across projects** (scan rows to compare metrics)
- **Create pivot tables** in Excel
- **Build charts** easily

## Excel Analysis Examples

### 1. Sort by Risk Level
You can sort the CSV to see which contracts have the most:
- Economic risks
- Overflow issues
- Unwrap usage
- Security issues

### 2. Create Comparison Charts
```
Contract Complexity Comparison:
‚îú‚îÄ damm-v2-main:  7607 LOC, 316 functions
‚îú‚îÄ raydium-amm:   8234 LOC, 289 functions
‚îî‚îÄ popfi-staking: 5432 LOC, 178 functions
```

### 3. DeFi Pattern Analysis
```
DeFi Pattern Distribution:
‚îú‚îÄ damm-v2-main:  25 AMM, 1 Lending, 14 Vesting = 40 total
‚îú‚îÄ raydium-amm:   20 AMM, 0 Lending, 5 Vesting = 25 total
‚îî‚îÄ popfi-staking: 5 AMM, 0 Lending, 5 Vesting = 10 total
```

### 4. Security Risk Comparison
```
Security Metrics:
                    damm-v2  raydium  popfi
Unwrap Usage:         107      45      23
Overflow Risks:         9       3       1
Access Control:        80      45      12
```

## Data Aggregation Benefits

### Your Original Data Had:
- 40 DeFi pattern entries (many duplicates)
- 16 economic risk factor objects
- 217 program derive instances
- Nested arrays and complex objects

### Export Provides:
‚úÖ **5 aggregated DeFi metrics** instead of 40 raw entries  
‚úÖ **4 aggregated risk metrics** instead of 16 raw objects  
‚úÖ **1 derive count** instead of 217 individual entries  
‚úÖ **Clean numbers** ready for Excel analysis  
‚úÖ **~60 columns total** instead of 500+

## How to Open and Analyze

### Method 1: Direct Excel Import
1. Save the CSV content to a file `analysis-export.csv`
2. Open in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets
3. Data will be automatically formatted in columns

### Method 2: Excel Power Query
1. Excel ‚Üí Data ‚Üí From Text/CSV
2. Select the exported CSV file
3. Configure delimiter (comma)
4. Load and transform as needed

### Method 3: Programmatic Analysis
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV
df = pd.read_csv('factors-analysis-2025-10-10.csv')

# Transpose if needed (factors as columns, reports as rows)
df_transposed = df.set_index('Factor').T

# Analyze
print(df_transposed['DeFi Patterns - AMM Count'].mean())
print(df_transposed['Economic Risks - Overflow Count'].sum())
```
